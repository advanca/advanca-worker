## Style Guidelines

As a Rust project, it simply follows [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) which can be checked and enforced by [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt). Also, there are a few non-formatting advices such as [naming convention](https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/advice.md#names).

This repository has integrated format checker on the submitted code.
